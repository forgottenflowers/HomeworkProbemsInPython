# Example problem 1
# Write a short program to ask a user to input 2 numbers. The output
# should report which number is bigger (first or second number) or if
# they are equal.

num1 = int(input("Enter a number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter another number: "))

if num1 > num2:
    print("First number is bigger")
elif num1 < num2:
    print("Second number is bigger")
else:
    print("Both numbers are equal")
